# Clothes store using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## In an effort to develop a portfolio even without clients, I have decided to seek the assistance of AI to request a project to develop a generic clothing website with some specifications.

"Dear Arthur,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about your services for the creation of a website prototype for a generic clothing store. The website will primarily target Portuguese-speaking users and will consist of three main pages: the homepage, the offers page, and the new arrivals page.

For this prototype, I would like to emphasize that responsiveness is not a priority. The layout should be designed specifically for desktop viewing, as this will sufficiently meet our requirements for now.

Could you please provide me with a quote for this project, along with an estimated timeline for completion? Additionally, if you have any questions or need further clarification on the project scope, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and potentially collaborating on this project.

Best regards,
AI help"
